# Brian-Beckman-phors-Implementation

This is Brian Beckman's paper "The Physics of Racing" implementation of tire model "Pacejka Magic Formula" in Python!

The [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20190227233112/http://phors.locost7.info/contents.htm) for the paper!

In this project, I only implemented the longitudinal and lateral Pacejka Formula and the traction circle in chapters 21, 22 and 25.

The main goal is to emitate the same results and graphs as in the paper.

Here is the longitudinal pacejka curve:
